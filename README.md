# Overview
This repository contains a console application developed in C# for generating HL7 ADT files. The utility utilizes the "Bogus" and "HL7.Dotnetcore" NuGet packages to generate synthetic patient data and construct HL7 messages.

# How to use
- This app will ask you to enter the number of HL7 files to generate.
- And then it will ask you to enter the output directory path where generated HL7 files will be saved.
- And that's it. Press enter and it will start generating file for you.

# Features

- Generate HL7 ADT files with patient information such as first name, last name, address, and more.
- Utilize the "Bogus" package to generate realistic fake patient data.
- Use the "HL7.Dotnetcore" package for building HL7 messages following the HL7 standard.
- Customize the number of HL7 files to generate.

Note: The generated HL7 ADT files are for demonstration and testing purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without proper validation and integration with relevant systems.
